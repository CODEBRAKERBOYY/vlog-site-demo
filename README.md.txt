** Vlog Blog Theme — WordPress from Scratch

This is a **custom WordPress blog theme** built entirely from scratch using **PHP, HTML, and CSS**.  
It was developed as part of my learning journey to understand **WordPress theme structure, templating, and customization**.


***  About the Project

The **Vlog Blog Theme** is a minimal developer-style blog layout designed and coded by **Alok Yadav**.  
It includes custom PHP templates for the homepage, single post pages, and a styled header/footer.  
All posts are dynamically displayed from WordPress.



** Features

-  100% custom-coded WordPress theme (no prebuilt templates)
-  Clean and responsive layout for posts
-  Centered featured images and readable typography
-  Structured theme files: `index.php`, `single.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`, `functions.php`
-  Built using VS Code and XAMPP (local environment)
-  Perfect for learning and portfolio display
